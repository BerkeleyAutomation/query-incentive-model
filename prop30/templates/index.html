<center><h3>California Proposition 30: Temporary Taxes to Fund Education.</h3></center>
<p>Everyone who is interested in education in California -- students, alumni, teachers, parents, employers -- should be aware of Proposition 30 on the November 2012 California ballot. It proposes temporary tax increases of 0.25% in the state sales tax and an incremental increase in personal income tax on households earning more than $250,000. If the measure does not pass, a multi-billion dollar cut in state funding to education at <em>all levels</em> will be triggered automatically.</p>

Whether you support or oppose the initiative, we invite you to help
raise awareness regarding the important choices facing California
voters. Please enter your email address and we'll send you a custom
web link to this page that you can share with your friends and family
using Email, Facebook, or Twitter. When they visit and add their email
addresses, we'll keep track. After the election, we'll contact the 50
Most Influential People from this site to ask if they'd like to be
listed on the website. We compute influence using the Kleinberg and
Raghavan algorithm. Your influence value increases by one point for
each person you invite, and by half a point for every person those
people invite, and so on.
