<p align="justify">The Proposition 30 Awareness Project is produced by the <a href="http://opinion.berkeley.edu/ddi">CITRIS Data and Democracy Initiative</a>, in cooperation with the <a href="http://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley AMP Lab</a>. The project computes influence using the Kleinberg and Raghavan algorithm. Your influence value increases by one point for each person you invite, and by half a point for every person those people invite, and so on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>About Prop 30</h4>
<p align="justify">Everyone who is interested in education in California -- students, alumni, teachers, parents, employers -- should be aware of Proposition 30 on the November 2012 California ballot. It proposes temporary tax increases of 0.25% in the state sales tax and an incremental increase in personal income tax on households earning more than $250,000. If the measure does not pass, a multi-billion dollar cut in state funding to education at <em>all levels</em> will be triggered automatically.</p>
